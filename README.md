# Chain Logos

A collection of normalized blockchain logos.

### Requirements

- **Format:** PNG
- **Ratio:** 1:1
- **Size:** 400x400px

The naming convention for logos is `<chain>Logo.png` where the chain name is
lowercase and contains no spaces.

**Example:** _Polygon ZKEVM -> polygonzkevm_

---

All logos are strictly 400x400px as I use them in Farcaster Frames where large
images drastically slow down page load times. Please keep all larger logos on
the `full` branch with the same naming conventions.
